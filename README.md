# personalprojects
In this folder I included a variety of programs created in different programs.

Andross
  I made an animated face based off of the star fox character.  Similar to the game, it shoots white bricks.  I made this with Javascript and a touch of html.
Shell
  I made a generic Shell program using C, similar to those we use on our linux computers at school.  It works about just as good as the school software.  Demonstrates mastery of pipe, child, fork, and C.
