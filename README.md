# Projects
In this folder I included a variety of programs created in different programs.

Andross

  I made an animated face based off of the star fox character.  Similar to the game, it shoots white bricks.  I made this with Javascript and a touch of html.
  
Shell

  I made a generic Shell program using C, similar to those we use on our linux computers at school.  It works about just as good as the school software.  Demonstrates mastery of pipe, child, fork, and C.

Minesweeper
  
  Project I worked on for fun last summer.  Created with Java, this game allows you to choose a size for the board and functions like a regular old default Microsoft Minesweeper game.  Demonstrates mastery of JFrame, JButtons, Mouselisteners, etc.
